## 👋 Welcome to My Profile
I was originally headed for a career in dentistry, but I developed an interest in data analytics. A new degree later, now I'm interested in digging into data to find cool stories and insights that help make better decisions. Check out some of the projects I've been working on here. Enjoy exploring!
